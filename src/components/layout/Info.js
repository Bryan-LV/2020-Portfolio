          My front-end applications are built primarily using React/vanilla javascript and my backend in Node/Express.
          I am well versed in the land of CSS, being able to work with pre-processors, CSS-in-JS libraries, and CSS libraries like Bootstrap.
          I have helped many business owners create elegant and responsive designs with good UX/UI principles. 
          Worked in an agency that developed E-commerce websites using Wordpress.
          When I am not coding, you can find me making music and exploring the world.
